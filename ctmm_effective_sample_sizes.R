# SMALL EFFECTIVE SAMPLE SIZES
###########

# What is an "effective sample size" (ESS)?
# also called "degrees of freedom" (DOF)
# Example: consider the standard error of the IID mean estimate from Statistics 101:
# S.E. = S.D./sqrt(n)
# S.E. = the standard error (uncertainty) of the mean estimate
# S.D. = the standard deviation of the process itself
# n    = the nominal sample size (the actual number of data points)
# With larger 'n', the standard error (uncertainty) is smaller 
# But with autocorrelated data, this exact relationship does not hold
# Given S.E., then inverting the relationship S.E. = S.D./sqrt(N)
# to get N = S.D.^2/S.E.^2 then 'N' is the "effective sample size"
# N is a relative measure of the certainty
# For IID data, N=n. The effective sample size is the nominal sample size
# For autocorrelatd data, N<n. The effective sample size is less than the nominal sample size
# If you had N IID data points, then you would get the same quality estimate
